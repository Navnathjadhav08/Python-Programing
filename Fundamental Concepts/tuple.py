"""An empty tuple is constructed by an empty pair of parentheses such
as myempty = () . However, a tuple with a single item is not so
simple. You have to specify it using a comma following the first (and
only) item so that Python can differentiate between a tuple and a pair
of parentheses surrounding the object in an expression i.e. you have
to specify singleton = (2 , ) if you mean you want a tuple
containing the item 2 ."""
